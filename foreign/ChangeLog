	* /home/rdevel/CVS-ARCHIVE/R-packages/foreign/src/SASxport.c (next_xport_info):
	initialized *tailpad to 0. Fixed value of *tailpad
	when end of file occurs while trying to get a new record (line
	350). Fixed possible memory leaks in case of call to error.
	(xport_info):  Fixed possible memory leaks in case of call to
	error. Removed most of the Calloc-ed arrays and replaced them with R
	objects.

	* src/SASxport.c (next_xport_info): fixed computation of
	tailpad when restOfCard != 0. The earlier method used ftell which
	can give wrong results for long files.

	* R/read.S.R, man/read.S.Rd:
	New files adapted from package Rstreams to read S3 objects and dumps.

	character of the field ' '.

	Both of these changes are based on bug report by Akio Sone.
