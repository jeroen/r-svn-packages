1.9-2
- gtkDevice now returns an error in the absense of RGtk
- Added PACKAGE argument to all foreign function calls, conforming to 
  R CMD check

1.9-1
_ Graphics engine changes (from Paul Murrell) folded in

- Clipping rectangle setting now uncommented.
- .C() calls use PACKAGE argument to avoid symbol in base.
