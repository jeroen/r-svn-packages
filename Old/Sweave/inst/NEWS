CHANGES COMPARED TO SWEAVE IN R 2.7.x

  o Sweave no longer inserts a hard path to the latex style file
    Sweave.sty. Users should add the file to their regular latex path
    and add a \usepackage{Sweave} statement to the preamble of the
    document (like with every other latex style file). Argument
    stylepath no longer exists.

  o The FAQ is now a package vignette.

  o Only PDF versions of graphics are created by default.

  o The environment where code chunks are evaluated can be set by the
    user.
