Last update: 2004-10-15 [SU]
*	code cleanups to get rid of most warnings
*	fixed linking issues caused by run_Rmainloop confliucting with R

Last update: 2004-10-14 [SU]
*	fixed output synchronization. all console output sources eventually
	use writeConsoleDirectly: and the insertion point is controlled by
	outputPosition.
*	add more flexible flush support (flushROutput and FlushStdConsole)
*	fixed document handling to be consistent with Cocoa; this means
	that menu items are handled implicitly by the first responder
	(where possible) and most default actions apply to the editor.
	Old versions of R GUI didn't have this, but mainly because there
	was no good editor supplied.
*	removed all global flags (IsRTF, IsREdit, ...)
*	toolbar icons changed (new icons added, some re-worked)
*	added menu+shortcut for "switch to console"
*	moved some menu items to logically more suitable places
	(e.g. "New document" is in "File" ...)
*	changed drop-document handling; the document is loaded in the editor
	(it can be easily executed by <Cmd><Enter> if necessary)
*	fixed activation of Quartz to use FR dispatching (this way it's not
	enabled in the console or editor where it doesn't make any sense)

Last update: 2004-10-13 [SI]
*	added support for activation of quartz device
	and creation of new quartz deivce from the GUI
	This functionality was present in the old Aqua GUI.
	
Last update: 2004-10-11 [SI]
*	first svn release

Last update: 2004-10-10 [SU]
*	fixed ?/help handling removed in the last update
*	fixed improper memory handling of external input
*	added queue to the console input to allow multiple simultaneous
	inputs while R is still working
*	fixed color handling - input text has now the correct color
*	added some constraints that prevent user from accidentally
	leaving the prompt area
*	fixed focus issues with the help window
*	don't unnecessarily repeat console input before commit
*	doProcessEvents: processes exactly one event in the blocking mode
*	added first release of R FAQ. To build it use [SI]
	makeinfo -D UseExternalXrefs --html --force --no-split RMacOSX-FAQ.texi
*	added "Docs" target to automatically build above FAQ
*	added sush dependency to R target - now it is possible to build
	the entire project from scratch by simply typing "xcodebuild"
	on the command line. Although it's the default, more precise
	specification of the target and build style can be used such as:
	xcodebuild -target R -buildstyle Deployment

Last update: 2004-10-09 [SU]
*	fixes in REngine (mem mgmt, 0 ptr fix); added executeString method
*	fixed package loading (use executeString and check the result)
*	huge cleanup of the R/Obj-C interface (stage 1). the interface is
	separated from RController by REPLHandler protocol. the R-side
	implementation is in Rcallbacks and RController implements the
	REPL protocol
*	changed output/console/prompt handling. this also makes sure that
	a prompt is always printed at the beginning of the line, no matter
	whether the previous output line is unfinished
*	raise the line buffer size from 1k to 32k, also it's not hard-coded now,
	but can be changed on the fly.
*	replace all evaluateString: with executeString: if the return value is
	not needed (ignoring the return value of eval.. causes memory leaks)
*	after history paste make textView the first respondent
	
Last update: 2004-10-08 [SI]
*	added toolbar colors icon and functionality. User can set font colors for
	the R Console window. Settings are saved automatically on exit. Just for
	fun: added also transparency of the R Console window.
*	console font size saved in the preferences
*	the color of the cursors is set to be the same as the prompt one

Last update: 2004-10-04 [SI]
*	fixed problem with applescript. Now uses scriptSuite and scriptTerminology
*	in sendIpunt: a fake keydown event is now generate to wake the event loop
	this is needed for both applescript and menu interaction
*   help(topic) and ?topic	are now handled internally and the help page is
	shown in the internal browser. 
	This is only a temporary solution. The correct approach is to create a
	new API to be called on each .show_help_on_topic_as_HTML call. Too late
	for release 2.0.0 of R.
*	Every call to Rengine evaluateString and parse causes R to be set in busy 
	state this allows for feedback to the user at any REngine use.
*	added support to save quartz device to PDF file. This is currently done
	using devcopy onto the pdf device. Native Cocoa methods like 
	[NSView dataWithPDFInsideRect] don't work at the moment because we don't
	use NSGraphicsContext. Should probably be done for the next release.
*	added clipboard copying into TIFF, PICT and PDF format
*	added support for printing of the graphics device, the console and the
	other editor windows
*	user input is now splitted in lines terminated by '\n'. This allows for
	copy and paste of bug documents. There's no limit to the input buffer
	apart from free memory. The input is just splitted in lines but if lines
	are longer than the maximum allowed by R (1024 currently) no action
	is taken, lines are just passed to R for at most 1024 bytes.
