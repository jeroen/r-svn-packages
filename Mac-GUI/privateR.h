/* Whenever R.app needs access to private R headers, it should use
   this header instead. It is a proxy and makes sure everything is
   set up correctly - most notably config.h was not part of
   PrivateHeaders before 2.3.0 and this causes some headache.
   The long-term goal is to remove the dependency on R private
   headers alltogether, but we're not there yet.

/* since Xcode may be using different compiler/flags than R, we have to make sure that inlining behavior is ok. Specifically, Xcode doesn't use -std=gnu99 which changes the inlining, so if we are in Leopard's gcc *and* Xcode didn't enable C99 then we have to override the inline semantics flag as it will be wrong! I have fixed this for R-devel (2.7.0-to-be), but previous R versions need it. */
