TO DO LIST
* metric info in quartz device is broken [SI]
* growing up the window in quartz device does not refresh the drawing [SI]
* we need to assume Latin1Econdig for displaying text in quartz (see example(text))[SI]
* move the refresh button in databrowse into the toolbar [SI]   
* preference pane: startup dir, install dir?
* in R_EditFiles:  the file name is not correctly set at the moment for newly created documents.
* (find someone to) design some nice icons for the toolbar
* should cut input longer than R buffer (1024). At the moment long user input is cutted into
  lines of at most 1024 bytes. We could probably cut them into less longer lines to allow
  for virtual any input length.
* Jan suggested to add coloring to the package installer to distinguish between installed and
  update packages, and non updated ones.
* REngine should wait R to finish. It would be nice to add a flag to evaluateString method 
  like "wait" set to YES by default. The reason is that calling multiple times REngine
  can crash R [[SU: this is a more general problem, we need synchronization of R activity...]]

- general issues:
	- font size handling is a mess - we need a global way to change font type and size for
	  all documents, including console and editor windows
- workspace browser:
	- disable "refresh" while data are fetched
	- use toolbar instead of fixed the button
	- edit/delete should apply to the *selected* object, not the root of the selected object ...
	- dbl-click should be edit
	- doesn't work with large workspaces (check why...)
- data editor:
	- adding rows doesn't shift contents of factors
	- add way to rename a column
	- editing fully NA objects causes problems (try m<-matrix(,5,5))
- code editor:
	- use code completion
	- use fixed font by default
- data manager
	- rename to Data Browser
	- add "search" field
	- allow columns to be sorted by clicking on the header 
	- don't query stats/base for datasets, because of the warnings
	- prints "empty env.." to the console .. bad boy
	
RController.m:
	- isImageData: - check whether compressed images are recognized (I doubt it..)
